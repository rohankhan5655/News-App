News Website

Welcome to my news website!

What's the issue?

I've encountered a common problem faced by frontend developers: the News API doesn't fetch data on the server. This means that, unfortunately, you won't be able to see live news articles on this website when deployed to a server.

But don't worry!

You can still see the news articles in action on your local machine. To do so, simply clone this repository, install the dependencies, and run the website on your localhost.

How to run locally

Clone this repository using git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies using npm install or yarn install
Run the website using npm start or yarn start
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port number specified in your package.json file)
Why is this happening?

The News API requires a subscription or an API key to fetch data, which can be a challenge to set up on a server. As a frontend developer, I've focused on building a functional news website, but I haven't implemented the API key or subscription on the server-side.

What's next?

If you're interested in contributing to this project, feel free to help me figure out a solution to fetch the News API on the server! I'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions on how to overcome this common issue.

Thank you for checking out my news website, and I hope you enjoy exploring it on your local machine!
